      instance or another resource.  '
    name: AWS::EFS::FileSystem
    properties:
    - Encrypted:
      - A Boolean value that, if true, creates an encrypted file system. When creating
        an
      - encrypted file system, you have the option of specifying a KmsKeyId for an
        existing
      - AWS Key Management Service (AWS
      - KMS) customer master key (CMK). If you don't specify a CMK, then the default
        CMK for
      - Amazon EFS, /aws/elasticfilesystem, is used to protect the encrypted file
        system.
      - 'Required: Conditional'
      - 'Type: Boolean'
      - 'Update requires: Replacement'
    - FileSystemTags:
      - A value that specifies to create one or more tags associated with the file
        system.
      - Each
      - tag is a user-defined key-value pair. Name your file system on creation by
        including
      - a
      - '"Key":"Name","Value":"{value}" key-value pair.'
      - 'Required: No'
      - 'Type: List of ElasticFileSystemTag'
      - 'Update requires: No interruption'
    - KmsKeyId:
      - The ID of the AWS KMS CMK to be used to protect the encrypted file system.
        This
      - parameter is only required if you want to use a nondefault CMK. If this parameter
      - is not
      - specified, the default CMK for Amazon EFS is used. This ID can be in one of
        the following
      - 'formats:'
      - Key ID - A unique identifier of the key, for example
      - 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.
      - ARN - An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the key, for example
      - arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.
      - Key alias - A previously created display name for a key, for example
      - alias/projectKey1.
      - Key alias ARN - An ARN for a key alias, for example
      - arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:444455556666:alias/projectKey1.
      - If KmsKeyId is specified, the Encrypted parameter must be set to true.
      - 'Required: No'
      - 'Type: String'
      - 'Minimum: 1'
      - 'Maximum: 2048'
      - 'Update requires: Replacement'
    - LifecyclePolicies:
      - A list of policies used by EFS lifecycle management to transition files to
        the Infrequent
      - Access (IA) storage class.
      - 'Required: No'
      - 'Type: List of LifecyclePolicy'
      - 'Update requires: No interruption'
    - PerformanceMode:
      - The performance mode of the file system. We recommend generalPurpose
      - performance mode for most file systems. File systems using the maxIO performance
      - mode can scale to higher levels of aggregate throughput and operations per
        second
      - with a
      - tradeoff of slightly higher latencies for most file operations. The performance
        mode
      - can't be changed after the file system has been created.
      - 'Required: No'
      - 'Type: String'
      - 'Allowed Values: generalPurpose | maxIO'
      - 'Update requires: Replacement'
    - ProvisionedThroughputInMibps:
      - The throughput, measured in MiB/s, that you want to provision for a file system
        that
      - you're creating. Valid values are 1-1024. Required if ThroughputMode is set
        to provisioned. The upper limit for throughput is 1024 MiB/s.
      - You can get this limit increased by contacting AWS Support. For more information,
      - see Amazon EFS Limits That You Can Increase
      - in the Amazon EFS User Guide.
      - 'Required: Conditional'
      - 'Type: Double'
      - 'Update requires: No interruption'
    - ThroughputMode:
      - The throughput mode for the file system to be created. There are two throughput
        modes
      - to
      - 'choose from for your file system: bursting and provisioned. If you set ThroughputMode
        to provisioned,'
      - you must also set a value for ProvisionedThroughPutInMibps. You can decrease
        your file
      - system's throughput in Provisioned Throughput mode or change between the throughput
      - modes
      - "as long as it√¢\x80\x99s been more than 24 hours since the last decrease or\
        \ throughput mode"
      - change. For more,
      - see Specifying Throughput with Provisioned Mode
      - in the Amazon EFS User Guide.
