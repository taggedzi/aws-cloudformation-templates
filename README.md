## CloudFormation

The cloudformation templates are listed in the `templates/` folder. It is broken down by major feature, and associated features.  Each major service has its own file and the associated services are in that same file.

Each resource has a "MetaData" section with a description of the resource, references the properties (an options) as well as gives the URL to the document that resource was constructed from.
